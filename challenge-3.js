// Challenge 3A:
// What is the value of x in following operation:
// js: 
// let x = [] == ![];
// x ||= 7;

// (Can you answer this WITHOUT using JavaScript to check?)
// Answer: ... 

// Challenge 3B: 
// By only adjusting the second line of code, and without explicity assigning `x` a value, how can you make this code output 7?

let x = [] == ![];
x ||= 7; // Change this line.

console.log(x);
