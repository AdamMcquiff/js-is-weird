# JavaScript is Weird

Three small JavaScript challenges for a DWP recruitment event. These challenges highlight some of JavaScripts many oddities.

Inspired by [wtfjs](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs).

## Get Started

Each challenge is contained within its own file within the root folder (e.g. `/challenge-1.js`). 

You can find solutions and explanations in the `/solutions` folder (make sure to give the challenges a go before checking the solutions, though).

To get started: 
- If you don't have it installed, install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Clone this repo.
- Open each of the challenges from the root folder and read the problem(s).
- Answer the question or provide a solution as requested. You can work in the same file, and run the code via node in your terminal. (e.g. `node challenge-1.js`). 

If / when you're finished, compare your answers with the solutions in the `solutions` folder.
