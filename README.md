# JavaScript is Weird

Three small JavaScript challenges for a DWP recruitment event. These challenges intend to highlight some of the many oddities of JavaScript.

Inspired by [wtfjs](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs).

## Get Started

Each challenge is contained within its own file within the root folder. 

ou can find the solutions and explanations with the `/solutions` folder (make sure to give the challenges a go before checking the solutions).

To get started: 
- If you don't have it installed, install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Clone this repo.
- Open each of the challenges from the root folder (e.g. `challenge-1.js`) and read the problem.
- Write your solution in the same file, and run via node in your terminal. (e.g. `node challenge-1.js`). 

If / when you're finished, compare with solutions in the `solutions` folder.
